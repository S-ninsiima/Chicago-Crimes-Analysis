# Chicago Crime Analysis
Like any other major city, criminal activities can be rampant due to overpopulation, unemployment, poverty and other factors. Since 2001, the [Chicago police department](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) has made available crime data showing hot spots locations in Chicago and prevailing crimes in the city. This project is an attempt to understand the scope of crimes in Chicago using the same data and extract useful insights to be used and exemplified by police in other countries.
